# GPS Toll-based System Simulation

This project simulates a GPS-based toll collection system using Python. It models vehicle movements, toll zone interactions, and payment processes to provide insights into the operation of modern, GPS-enabled toll systems.

## Key Features:
- Vehicle movement simulation along predefined routes
- Toll zone definition using GPS coordinates
- Distance calculation for vehicles within toll zones
- Dynamic toll calculation based on distance or zone crossings
- Payment simulation for toll charges

## Python Libraries and Frameworks: 
- SimPy: For event-driven simulation of vehicle movements
- GeoPandas & Shapely: For geospatial analysis and toll zone definitions
- GeoPy: For GPS coordinate distance calculations
- Pandas: For data management and analysis
- Matplotlib & Folium: For data visualization and mapping

This simulation project aims to provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing and visualizing GPS-based toll systems
